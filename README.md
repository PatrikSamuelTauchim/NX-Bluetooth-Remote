# NX-Bluetooth-Remote
DIY hardware and software developed to control Samsung NX1000 Camera remotely, using bluetooth (SPP) compatible device (Phone/PC/...) or by wire using USB. Ability to take set amount of pictures with user defined delay both before shooting and between each shot. Posibility for setting time for how long shutter button is pressed - useful for burst and Bulb modes.

* Probably compatible with other Samsung NX cameras, but untested. For some models resistor of different value (in cable) AND/OR firmware modification may be needed.

Price: DIY under 15â‚¬

**Features done:**
* Remote shutter - Allows to take single shot
* Continuous shooting - take specific amount of shots with defined delay between them
* Android App for wireless control via Bluetooth - [Avaliable on wiki](https://github.com/PatrikSamuelTauchim/NX-Bluetooth-Remote/wiki/Software)
* Windows Universal Platform for use on Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile devices for wireless control via Bluetooth

**Features not done:**
* Desktop app Linux - For now, serial terminal is enough to send commands manually. Just connect USB cable from Arduino module or establish Bluetooth connection. [Details at wiki](https://github.com/PatrikSamuelTauchim/NX-Bluetooth-Remote/wiki/Software)
* More parameters to be set
* Ability to create and safe/load profile for apps 
* And more

**HW features**
* Battery operation from Li-Ion cell and charging from USB, which can be also used for control.
* Matchbox size

**Development status:**
* 20.10.2015 - Working prototype based on ATMEGA8 dev board - better HW ordered already. Check wiki for picture :-)
* 13.12.2015 - Arduino Nano based prototype. Basically final version with part list published. Check wiki for new pictures :-)
* 30.12.2015 - Android App published. Arduino Nano protype got some wiring  changes, new software with new command format support and basic feature set (take X photos, with Y delay and Z shutter hold time).
* 13.8.2016 - Windows Universal Platform app published
